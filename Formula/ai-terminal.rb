  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      ai-terminal has been installed to:
        #{prefix}/ai-terminal.app
      
      You can also run it from the terminal with the command:
        ai-terminal
      
      For best experience, you need Ollama installed for AI features:
        brew install ollama
    EOS

  test do
    # Basic check for app existence
    assert_predicate "#{prefix}/ai-terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/ai-terminal", :exist?
